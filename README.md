# libmatrix
A small linear algebra lib written in C. It can perform matrix inversion, QR and
LU decompositions, and compute determinants and eigenvalues. In the
[examples](https://github.com/davifeliciano/libmatrix/tree/master/examples)
subdir there are a few small examples of applications. The subdirs
[taks1](https://github.com/davifeliciano/libmatrix/tree/master/task1) and
[taks2](https://github.com/davifeliciano/libmatrix/tree/master/task2) are also
examples, and each one is described in a separate README file inside it.
Finally, [libcsv](https://github.com/rgamble/libcsv) is the only dependency of
this project. It is a csv parser developed by
[rgamble](https://github.com/rgamble).
