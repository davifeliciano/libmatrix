This project is a implementation of the QR decomposition algorithm (Household version)
and it application on the computation of the real eigenvalues of a matrix, given by a
.csv file as a command line argument.

task2_qr prints on screen the QR decomposition and the product Q*R.
task2_eigen prints on screen the real eigenvalues.
test.csv is a random matrix generated by

    ../examples/random_matrix 5 5 -o ./test.csv

task2.nb is a Mathematica Notebook File that show the solution, for comparation purposes.
task2.png is a screenshot of this Mathematica Notebook.

To compile both programs, type

    make all && make clean

in a linux terminal. To run each program, type

    ./task2_qr matrix_file.csv
    ./task2_eigen matrix_file.csv

replacing matrix_file by the name of the .csv file storing the matrix
you want to load. Some examples of usage of this matrix library are shown in examples directory.
To compile them type the same command as before, but in examples dir.
I have not intensivelly tested any of the algorithms, so keep in mind that you may find some bugs.
